### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a multidiscipliend engineer with around 8 years of experience in oil and gas. You can ask me about field instrumentation, desitributed control systems, and metering. I have also developed a number of embedded systems which can be found on my repositories. I can code in C and Python.

Apart from that I enjoy my mechanical keyboard, cooking, travel, and classical music!
